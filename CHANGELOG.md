## v1.0.0

The simplest thing this library could be. The main `apa102.h` file has the
hardware SPI initialization & frame transmission functions along with the
`RGBColor_t` type.

The `apa102_effects.h` file contains some functions that output different
patterns directly to the hardware SPI, like flashing between a sequence of
colors, extending/retracting solid colors, or scrolling a sequence of colors
up/down the saber.
